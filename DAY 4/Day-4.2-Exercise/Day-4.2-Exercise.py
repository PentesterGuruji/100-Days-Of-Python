# ##split --> .split the list into words
# ##logic first i get the length of the list 
# ##then using the random interger function to get the  one random number in the list --> but the problem is that len function counts like normal ,, and it creates a problem "out of range"  to fix this subtracting 1 from the random number to make it correct .

### ex if list is name{'guruji', 'peru' , 'hai'}
### there is 3 items means length is 3
# ##but you can't select 3 in that list coz python start with zero

# ##then using that random number to fetch the item in the list list[number]
