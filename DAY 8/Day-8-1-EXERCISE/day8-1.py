###Area cal Exercise

####Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡


def paint_calc(height,width,cover):
    number_of_can = ( height*width)/cover
    roundoff = round(number_of_can + 0.4)
    print(f"You'll need {roundoff} cans of paint.")
    


### if the number of can is 1.25 round will be 1 but we need 2 . so i am adding 0.4 evertime to get desired round off
