# Hurdles race
# Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.

# The position and number of hurdles changes each time this world is reloaded.
# What you need to know
# The functions move() and turn_left().
# The conditions front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), at_goal(), and their negation.
# How to use a while loop and an if statement.
# Your program should also be valid for worlds Hurdles 1 and Hurdles 2.
