for n in student_heights:
    sum_of_heights += n

# #if we are using it will be very easy
# #len(student_heights)
# #sum(student_heights)


###### solution 

## sum method is same but to get the total number approach is different

## 

# number_of_student = 0

# for x in student_heights:
#     number_of_student += 1

# print(number_of_student)

## conclusion loop will run according to entries in the list..

# so everytime it loop it will add 1 and we get our value:) noice approach too

# my count method is desi jugad
